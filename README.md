# tclpysh-Docs
tclpysh is a hybrid Tcl+Python interpreter built on DashThru FusionShell core, designed for modern EDA scripting workflows. Unlike traditional tools that separate Tcl and Python into distinct modes or environments, tclpysh enables both languages to be written in a single script, with real-time mode switching and native variable sharing.
